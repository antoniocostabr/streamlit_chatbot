## Description
This project implements a conversational app using Streamlit, allowing users to interact with a chatbot interface. For
cost saving the app uses the OpenAI gpt-3.5-turbo by default.

## Instructions
0. Place a `.env` file in the same folder as this script containing your OpenAI API key. The key should be named `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
1. Run the Streamlit app by executing this script in your terminal: streamlit run app.py
2. Interact with the chatbot by typing messages and receiving responses in the Streamlit interface.
